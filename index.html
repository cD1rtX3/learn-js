		<h1>Basic JavaScript Concepts</h1>
		<h2>Introduction:</h2>
		<p>
			While learning to code is often said to be difficult, it's actually quite the
			opposite. Languages like JavaScript are built to be simple to understand and
			use, making learning easy with the right teacher.
		</p>
		<p>
			Take this example code block:
		</p>
		<code>
			<kw>let</kw> arr = <brac1>[]</brac1>;<br>
			<kw>for</kw> <brac1>(</brac1><kw>let</kw> i = <num>0</num>; i &lt; <num>10</num>; i++<brac1>) {</brac1><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arr<brac1>[</brac1>i<brac1>]</brac1> = i;<br>
			<brac1>}</brac1><br>
			<br>
			<kw>for</kw> <brac1>(</brac1><kw>let</kw> i <kw>in</kw> arr<brac1>) {</brac1><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<kw>let</kw> r = Number<brac1>(</brac1>i<brac1>)</brac1> + <clss>Math</clss>.trunc<brac1>(</brac1><clss>Math</clss>.random<brac2>()</brac2> * <brac2>(</brac2>arr.length - Number<brac3>(</brac3>i<brac3>)</brac3><brac2>)</brac2><brac1>)</brac1>;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<kw>let</kw> t = arr<brac1>[</brac1>i<brac1>]</brac1>;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arr<brac1>[</brac1>i<brac1>]</brac1> = arr<brac1>[</brac1>r<brac1>]</brac1>;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arr<brac1>[</brac1>r<brac1>]</brac1> = t;<br>
			<brac1>}</brac1>
		</code>
		<p>
			It may look intimidating now, but breaking it down into its simple constructs
			yields an easy to follow pattern, and by the end of this module, you should be
			able to tell what this code is doing.
		</p>
		<h2>Your First Program:</h2>
		<p>
			Let's start with something a little less intimidating: a one-line program that
			prints the phrase &ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo;.
		</p>
		<code>
			<com>// Hi!</com><br>
			console.log<brac1>(</brac1><str>"Hello, world!"</str><brac1>)</brac1>;
		</code>
		<p>
			Put this into a JavaScript interpreter (you can get one on this very site by
			pressing Ctrl+Shift+I and going into the console), and it will log that phrase
			to the console. Congratulations! You have written your very first program. Let's
			run down how it works.
		</p>
		<p>
			Working from the outside in, the semicolon at the end tells JavaScript that you
			are done with your statement, like the period in English. It doesn't technically
			need to be there &mdash; the line ending tells enough &mdash; but examples here will have
			it included.
		</p
		<p>
			That green thing at the top is a comment. Comments are ignored by JavaScript, but
			are helpful for humans reading your code. Single-line comments start with <il-code>//</il-code> and
			go to the end of the line, and multi-line comments start with <il-code>/*</il-code> and end with
			<il-code>*/</il-code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<il-code>console.log</il-code> is a function that prints out any arguments you give it. The
			curved brackets at the end enclose a list of arguments (though, in this case,
			there is only one).
		</p>
		<p>
			The single argument given to <il-code>console.log</il-code> is the string <il-code>"Hello, world!"</il-code>. The
			quotes around it tell JavaScript that it is a string.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of everything listed above, if you ran the code, you should see in the
			console:
		</p>
		<code>
			Hello, world!
		</code>
		<details>
		<summary>But What's That Underneath?</summary>
		<p>
			If you ran the code in the DevTools console (the one that pops up with
			Ctrl+Shift+I), you probably noticed that underneath our glorious message is:
		</p>
		<code>
			undefined
		</code>
		<p>
			What's that? As stated above, <il-code>console.log</il-code> is a function, and in JavaScript,
			functions have what is called a return value, which is just the value handed
			back by the function. In the case of <il-code>console.log</il-code>, the return value is simply
			<il-code>undefined</il-code>, which isn't very useful, but other functions exist that have cooler
			return values, like the function <il-code>Math.sqrt</il-code>:
		</p>
		<code>
			<clss>Math</clss>.sqrt<brac1>(<num>9</num>)</brac1> <com>// Returns 3</com>
		</code>
		<p>
			We'll get into functions more later, but for now, that's why the console says
			<il-code>undefined</il-code>.
		</p>
		</details>
		<h2>Variables:</h2>
		<p>
			After saying hi to the world, the first step on our journey brings us to
			variables. Variables are how you store data in code. They are declared using
			the keyword <il-code>let</il-code>:
		</p>
		<code>
			<kw>let</kw> foo;
		</code>
		<p>
			You can use these just as you would any data:
		</p>
		<code>
			<com>// Prints "Hi!".</com><br>
			<kw>let</kw> foo = <str>"Hi!"</str>;<br>
			console.log<brac1>(</brac1>foo<brac1>)</brac1>;
		</code>
			<!-- 5   10   15   20   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   70   75 -->
