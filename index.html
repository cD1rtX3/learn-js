		<h1>Basic JavaScript Concepts</h1>
		<h2>Introduction:</h2>
		<p>
			It is a commonly held belief that learning to code is a difficult
			task. However, quite the opposite is the case. Languages like
			JavaScript are built to be simple to understand and use, making
			learning easy with the right teacher.
		</p>
		<p>
			Take this example code block:
		</p>
		<code>
			<kw>let</kw> arr = <brac1>[]</brac1>;<br>
			<kw>for</kw> <brac1>(</brac1><kw>let</kw> i = <num>0</num>; i &lt; <num>10</num>; i++<brac1>) {</brac1><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arr<brac1>[</brac1>i<brac1>]</brac1> = i;<br>
			<brac1>}</brac1><br>
			<br>
			<kw>for</kw> <brac1>(</brac1><kw>let</kw> i <kw>in</kw> arr<brac1>) {</brac1><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<kw>let</kw> r = i + <clss>Math</clss>.random<brac1>()</brac1> * <brac1>(</brac1>arr.length - i<brac1>)</brac1>;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<kw>let</kw> t = arr<brac1>[</brac1>i<brac1>]</brac1>;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arr<brac1>[</brac1>i<brac1>]</brac1> = arr<brac1>[</brac1>r<brac1>]</brac1>;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arr<brac1>[</brac1>r<brac1>]</brac1> = t;<br>
			<brac1>}</brac1>
		</code>
		<p>
			It may look intimidating now, but breaking it down into its simple
			constructs yields an easy to follow pattern, and by the end of this
			module, you should be able to tell what this code is doing.
		</p>
		<h2>Basic Syntax:</h2>
		<p>
			Syntax is the bread and butter of a programming or scripting
			language. Many facets of JavaScript's syntax are situational and
			will be covered in their corresponding sections, but a few aren't
			and should be covered up here.
		</p>
		<p>
			JavaScript is a &ldquo;whitespace-agnostic&rdquo; language, meaning
			it doesn't really care what whitespace is used, and often doesn't
			care that whitespace is used at all. This means that characters like
			tabulations and carriage returns are mostly just for humans reading
			the code.
		</p>
		<p>
			Statements in JavaScript (and in most computer languages) end in a
			semicolon:
		</p>
		<code>
			<kw>let</kw> foo = <num>1</num>;
		</code>
		<p>
			This tells JavaScript that you are finished with your statement,
			similar to the period in English.
		</p>
		<p>
			Single-line comments are declared with two slashes, like this:
		</p>
		<code>
			<com>// This is a comment.</com>
		</code>
		<p>
			Multi-line comments are between a pair of <il-code>/*</il-code> and
			<il-code>*/</il-code>, like this:
		</p>
		<code>
			<com>
			/*<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a multi-line comment. It can (as its name<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suggests) span multiple lines. It is useful for<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;writing large blocks of text to help a reader<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand your code.<br>
			*/
			</com>
		</code>
		<h2>Variables:</h2>
		<p>
			Variables are how you store data within a script and are declared
			like this:
		</p>
		<code>
			<kw>let</kw> foo = <num>0</num>;
		</code>
		<p>
			The <il-code>let</il-code> keyword, as you may have guessed,
			declares a variable. Variable names are case-sensitive
			(capitalization matters) and can be any string of letters, numbers,
			and/or underscores (_), though they cannot start with a number.
		</p>
		<p>
			Perhaps an unintuitive facet of the language is the assignment
			(<il-code>=</il-code>) operator, which is a single equals sign. This is
			not to be confused (though it often is) with the equivalance operator
			(<il-code>==</il-code>, two equals signs). The assignment operator assigns
			a value to a variable and can be used in a <il-code>let</il-code> statement
			as above or on its own if the variable has already been declared:
		</p>
		<code>
			foo = <num>2</num>;
		</code>
		<p>
			They can also be chained:
		</p>
		<code>
			foo = bar = <num>3</num>;
		</code>
		<p>
			Multiple variables can be declared in a single statement, like this:
		</p>
		<code>
			<kw>let</kw> a = <num>0</num>, b = <num>1</num>, c = <num>2</num>;
		</code>
		<p>
			and a variable does not have to be given a value:
		</p>
		<code>
			<kw>let</kw> foo;
		</code>
		<h2>Data Types:</h2>
		<p>
			It's no fun to have variables if theres nothing to put in them.
			JavaScript has a few different types of things that can be put in
			a variable, one of which you have already seen &mdash; <il-code>number</il-code>s;
		</p>
		<h3>Numbers:</h3>
		<code>
			<com>// This is a number:</com><br>
			<num>3</num>
		</code>
		<p>
			That was a number. Numbers are exactly what they sound like. They
			can look like this:
		</p>
		<code>
			<num>3</num>
		</code>
		<p>
			like this:
		</p>
		<code>
			<num>3.2</num>
		</code>
		<p>
			or even like this:
		</p>
		<code>
			<num>1_083.2</num>
		</code>
		<h3>Strings:</h3>
		<p>
			A string is an amount of characters next to each other, like this:
		</p>
		<code>
			<str>"Hello!"</str>
		</code>
		<p>
			Note the quotes around it &mdash; those distinguish it from a variable
			name. They don't have to be double-quotes, either. They can be
			single-quotes:
		</p>
		<code>
			<str>'Hello!'</str>
		</code>
		<p>
			or graves (though grave-quotes have some special properties that
			we'll get to later):
		</p>
		<code>
			<str>`Hello!`</str>
		</code>
		<h3>Boolean:</h3>
		<p>
			A boolean is a true or a false value, and looks like this:
		</p>
		<code>
			<kw>true</kw>
		</code>
		<p>
			or this:
		</p>
		<code>
			<kw>false</kw>
		</code>
		<h3>Null and Undefined:</h3>
		<p>
			<il-code>null</il-code> is a purposefully-set &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; value:
		</p>
		<code>
			<kw>null</kw>
		</code>
		<p>
			while <il-code>undefined</il-code> is the value of an uninitialized variable
			(that is, one that hasn't had a value given to it):
		</p>
		<code>
			<kw>undefined</kw>
		</code>
			<!--   20   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   70   75 -->
