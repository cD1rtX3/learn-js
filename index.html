		<h1>Basic JavaScript Concepts</h1>
		<h2>Introduction:</h2>
		<p>
			It is a commonly held belief that learning to code is a difficult
			task. However, quite the opposite is the case. Languages like
			JavaScript are built to be simple to understand and use, making
			learning easy with the right teacher.
		</p>
		<p>
			Take this example code block:
		</p>
		<code>
			<kw>let</kw> arr = <brac1>[]</brac1>;<br>
			<br>
			<kw>for</kw> <brac1>(</brac1><kw>let</kw> i = <num>0</num>; i &lt; <num>10</num>; i++<brac1>) {</brac1><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arr<brac1>[</brac1>i<brac1>]</brac1> = i;<br>
			<brac1>}</brac1>
		</code>
		<p>
			While it may look intimidating now, breaking it down into its simple
			constructs yields an easy to follow pattern, and by the end of this
			module, you should be able to tell what this code is doing.
